# Fishing-Bot-World-of-Warcraft

## Sound recognition
This is a volume driven fish bot that uses interact button to cast/fish in wow using only the output sound. That is also the only sound in game you will have to have, bobber has to be the highest volume for this to work.

## Running the project
You will need visual studio to run this project. Open .sln in VS2022 and hit Run on the project called "Chrome" or alternatively hit build and use exe from bin folder.

### In game setup
You will need some sort of addon to bind fihsing/interaction button to. Default is the dot ("."). Make sure to mute all sounds in your game and leave only the fishing on. There are weakauras to achieve this, you can use an addon or just mute everything in game other than environment (I think, not sure). Rest is self explanatory.

## Legal disclaimer
This project has been made as a fun side project and I do not advice you use it on WoW official servers. Will you get banned? Probably not if you are cautious with it but at the end of the day you would be breaking the ToS and getting banned is a real possibility.
